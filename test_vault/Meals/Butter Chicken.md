3. Add the minced garlic, ginger, and green chili (if using), tomato paste, and 1/4 cup water. Sauté for another 1-2 minutes until fragrant.

6. Take the chicken out of the air fryer and roughly chop it into bite size pieces, add the cooked chicken to the sauce and stir to coat evenly. Let it simmer for 1-2 minutes.

7. Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and sugar if needed.

8. Garnish with fresh cilantro. Serve hot with steamed basmati rice, naan, or roti.
